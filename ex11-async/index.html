    <h2> A 25% improved game from <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Asynchronous/Timeouts_and_intervals#Active_learning_a_reaction_game"> Mozilla </a></h2>

    <p>We believed the game was improved by 25% from: </p>
    <ul>
	<li>The added complexity of having more than 1 page </li>
	<li>Adding the dynamic control of the movings cars</li>
	<li>Doing all of this asynchronously.</li>
    </ul>
